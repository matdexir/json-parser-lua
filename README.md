# json-parser-lua


This is an imperfect JSON parser made in lua. The goal was just to play around with JSON parsing and learn about any potential pitfalls.
When it comes to validation, I have taken inspiration from the [JSON test suite](https://github.com/nst/JSONTestSuite).


## Run tests

```
lua <test-file>.lua
```
